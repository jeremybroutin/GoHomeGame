Introduction to C# and Unity.

#####Description
Simple C# code that defines a Home and a Player location apart from each other using Vector2.<br>
The player can simply move its location using the keyboard arrows.<br>
The output of each move is printed to the console and displays the updated distance from home.<br>
When the Home location and Player location are matching, **game over**!<br>
